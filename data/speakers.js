    description: `<p>In Greek mythology, Daedalus (Greek: Δαίδαλος "to work artfully") was a skillful craftsman and artist who created the first Labyrinth. People like him still exist and are known as creative coders and code golfers. They push the limits of what is possible with JavaScript and open new doors for others.</p><p>Follow Martin on his journey through a maze of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML where the boundaries between art and code are blurred. This entertaining talk will show off invisible code, tweet-sized games, Asian programs, symmetric JavaScript, polyglot inceptions, self-modifying functions, exotic symbols and much more mind-blowing examples.</p>`.trim(),

    description: `<p>The speaker hits the “stage” with a guitar, playing memorable rock tunes using a web browser as an amplifier. This talk is about pushing the limits of what a web browser can do, and goes over pedalboard.js, an open source JavaScript framework for building real-time guitar effects in the browser.</p><p>Demonstrating both code and music, talking a little bit about math and signal processing, the speaker paints a picture of the current state of the web and how capable it is as a platform. He then goes on to present a way to make a collaborative music session using pedalboard.js over WebRTC, so people can play along with friends in real-time even if they are miles away.</p>`.trim(),
