<p>React 16 was released several months ago. Even though this update was largely API-compatible, the rewritten internal engine included new long-requested features and opened the door for exciting future possibilities.</p><p>In this talk, Dan will describe and demonstrate some of the recent React API additions. He will also share the React teamâ€™s vision for what the future of React might look like, including some never before seen prototypes.</p><p>Whether or not you use React, Dan hopes that you will find something valuable in this talk, and that it sparks new conversations about building delightful user interfaces.</p>
