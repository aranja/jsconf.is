JSConf is coming to Iceland, again! This time, the conference takes place on **March 1-2, 2018**. That's from Thursday through Friday. Perfect for catching up on talks, and with friends from the JavaScript community.

Those two days will be jam-packed. Expect two tracks of inspiring, motivational and educational talks, from over 30 speakers from around the world. The speaker selection will comprise curated speakers and audience volunteers. The
curated speakers <a href="http://cfp.jsconf.is/events/jsconf-iceland-2018"
target="_blank">submit proposals</a> and make it through the selection process, whereas the audience volunteer speakers are “first-come,
first-speak“.

### JSConf is all about the community

Connecting with people, hacking in the lounge, communal dining, partying and crawling the pubs together are all pieces that make up the essence of the JSConf experience. After the talks finish on each day, we’ll host grand parties for all to enjoy.

On **Saturday**, March 3, the adventure continues, and we encourage attendees to explore the wonders of Iceland—the rural nature, elven wonders and aurora-clad
horizon.

We conclude on **Sunday**, March 4, with a lazy brunch and a trip to the famous [Blue Lagoon](http://www.bluelagoon.com/).

Stay tuned for more info!
